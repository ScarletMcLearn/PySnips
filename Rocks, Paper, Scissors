#n our first mini-project, we will build a Python function 𝚛𝚙𝚜𝚕𝚜(𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎) that takes as input the string 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎, which is one of "𝚛𝚘𝚌𝚔", "𝚙𝚊𝚙𝚎𝚛", "𝚜𝚌𝚒𝚜𝚜𝚘𝚛𝚜", "𝚕𝚒𝚣𝚊𝚛𝚍", or "𝚂𝚙𝚘𝚌𝚔". The function then simulates playing a round of Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock by generating its own random choice from these alternatives and then determining the winner using a simple rule that we will next describe.
